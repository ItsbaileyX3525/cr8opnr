# CR8OPNR

I know what you are thinking, didn't you make a case opening simulator already? Yea I did but with this one its literally a project I have to make for college so in a way im legally double dipping this shi but in all srs tho, this version has many more features like account creation, more addictive gambling features and some other little minigames.

Also I think the biggest difference between CR8OPNR and cs2 spinner simulator is that whilst you can get cs2 skins from cases there is also just loads of other random things you can get from the cases like colours, animals and more!

## How to play

Getting setup is very simple, all you have to do is click your little dude in the top right corner of the screen and select register, that will take you take a page where you can create an account.

Upon creation of the account you will be redirected onto the main page where you will have 500 gems that you can mess around with to get into the grove of things, with those starting 500 gems you can buy some cases and see if you get some returns!

### Ran out of gems?

Every day you can claim a daily reward to add some more gems to your inventory to start messing around with the game again! There also might be the addition of quests where you can like open 1 case and get 50 gems or something.

Finally, the other way to get gems is to simply refer some friends to the game and get them addicted to the game too!

## Cases

There a load of different cases you can pick from like cs2 skins, colours and animals all of which will give you a gem return based on the worth of the item that you get, some cases will have a higher rate of return that other cases so make sure to catalog your winnings!

## Crash

A side game you can play where you can input some gems to bet and see how far the stock market rises before it crashes, if you withdraw before it crashes you get however much the mulitpler was when you cashed out!

## Mines

7x7 grid, 5 bombs. Don't click on the hidden bombs and watch your earnings rise through the roof... I mean what are the chances that you click a bomb, 5/49, talk about unlikely!

## Final words

Idk really, I guess just enjoy the website and don't get too addicted if the game does turn out to be addictive haha. Yh
